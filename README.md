# Minecraft Castle Builder (Educational Purpose)

This script is designed for Minecraft Education Edition or MakeCode for Minecraft. It builds a full medieval-style castle structure using chat commands.

## Features

The script defines and assembles several castle components:
- **Moat** – circular water-filled trench
- **Walls** – concentric defensive layers
- **Gate** – decorative entrance with dark oak fence
- **Bridge** – wooden connection over the moat
- **Towers** – two symmetrical towers with multiple levels
- **Palace** – main hall with glass windows, ladders, and multiple floors

## Usage

To trigger the build, enter the following command in the Minecraft chat:

```
castle
```

Additional helper commands:
- `helpCord` – places marker blocks for orientation and testing
- `clear` – clears the construction area

## Requirements

This script is meant to be used with:
- Minecraft Education Edition
- Minecraft Bedrock with Code Builder (MakeCode)
- A flat world with enough space

## Educational Note

This project was created for **educational purposes only**, to demonstrate:
- Procedural building in Minecraft using code
